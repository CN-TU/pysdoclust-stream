# Stream Clustering Robust to Concept Drift (Evaluation Experiments)

## Dependencies

We recommend using a clean python virtual environment:

        python3 -m venv venv

        source venv/bin/activate


Later, install dependencies by running:

        bash dependencies.sh

Finally, install SDOclustream as indicated in this repository


## Replication

To replicate evaluation experiments, simply run:

        bash run.sh 2> log.txt

It will generate two folders: [results] and [plots]
